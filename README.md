i'm a **griefer btales**, **harlequin tfc**, and **scout tf2** selfshipper. i'm sharing — or i just don't really care. i'm not trying to compete for either of the three characters as i find it obnoxious, so, non-sharing doubles kindly block! ""(·•᷄_•᷅ )

*"iwc nonsharing ~~diego/godot armando~~ yumes/fictkins or if you fight over my favourite characters. please"* **exactly this**, but with either of my fictive others. i don't have anything against doubles, but i've been harassed by one & don't want that happening yet again. : )
